Cross-Asset Noise Independence Test
==================================================

Covariance at 100ms (daily): 0.00029404
Covariance at 1min (daily):  0.00123025
Ratio (fine/coarse):         0.2390
Interpretation: Significant attenuation — noise effects dominate at fine frequencies

Residual correlation test (100ms demeaned returns):
  Coefficient (β): 0.709032
  Standard error:  0.000593
  t-statistic:     1196.23
  p-value:         0.00e+00
  Conclusion: Reject independence — microstructure noise is correlated across assets
